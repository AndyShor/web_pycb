# PyCB Charge Breeding Simulator - Modern Frontend

A  static web application for simulating charge breeding processes under electron flux.
Visit https://andyshor.github.io/web_pycb/ for use.

This realization has 30 seconds limitation on simulation time due to AWS API gateway integration.
Typically all simulations run smooth apart from heaviest species like U simulated for 1 or 10 seconds.
As those a rare cases in practise and this interface is for demo purpose only it is OK.
For exotic cases please run PyCB locally using the source code from https://github.com/AndyShor/PyCB
